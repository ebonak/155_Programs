I plan to run through all of the CPSC 155 programs in C# plus perhaps create
new programs.

For now I will put all of them under the same Solution as different projects
and see how that goes. Still not quite sure about how the various pieces inside
the projects hang together.

This will help me get familiar with the C# syntax and the VS 2015 IDE, though
most of what I need to learn about is Windows Forms.

Maybe also an opportunity to learn about unit testing and how Git integrates
with Visual Studio.

Fun fun.
